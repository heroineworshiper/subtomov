What you'll find here:


Subtomov creates a video containing just subtitles in a .mkv source. 
The video has to be composited with the source movie in an editor so the
subtitles appear on the bottom out of frame.

The journey begins by extracting an .idx & .sub file from a .mkv source.

Use the mkvinfo & mkvextract programs inside MKVToolNix_GUI to extract
the .idx & .sub.

cd mkvtoolnix/usr/bin; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../lib ./mkvinfo <input file>

This gives a bunch of Track type: subtitles.  Most have a Language:
field but some don't.  They also have a "track ID for mkvmerge &
mkvextract:" which is different than the track id for some reason.

You have to run mkvextract with the right track id for mkvextract.

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../lib ./mkvextract tracks <input file> <track id>:subtitles

This puts the time stamps & color palette for the subtitles in a
subtitles.idx file & the compressed subtitle images in a subtitles.sub
file.

The next step is to run subtomov to generate the rendered subtitle movie.

subtomov <input base path> <output path>

The input base path is the subtitles value passed to mkvextract.  It
adds the .idx & .sub on its own.  The output path is the movie.  This
runs ffmpeg to encode the movie.

In your video editor, place the subtitle video below the movie.  While
the .sub file contains an X & Y position for each subtitle, subtomov
draws them all on top of its output so the subtitles can go below the
movie.

Change the ON_TOP macro to preserve the encoded X & Y of the subtitles.
Change the CHROMA_ macros to fill the transparent area with a chroma key
color & overlap the movie, but it's most ergonomical to not overlap the
movie with the subtitles.
